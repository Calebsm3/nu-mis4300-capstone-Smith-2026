## project Title
Optimizing Advertising Spend to Maximize Unit Salesthe primary project 


## Questions for this Project

 * Which advertising channel (TV, radio, or newspaper) has the strongest measurable impact on unit sales, and how should an advertising budget be distributed to maximize sales performance?
 *  what  is the Predicted units sold based on ad spend by channel level(high/medium/low)?
 *   what is the marginal increase in units sold for every $10,000 spent?
 *    which channel has the most influence on volume?
   
## Why This Matters:

this matters becuase a lot of companies put a lot of money into these advirtisements without knowing which one truly drives unit sales.

## Dataset

My dataset's name is advirtising sales Dataset. I found this dataset on Kaggle, and it is a CSV file.

## Key Variables I Expect to Use:

I expect to use all four variables in my project, the four being:
 * TV Ad Budget, spending on TV advertising.
 * Radio Ad Budget, spending on radio advertising.
 * Newspaper Ad Budget, spending on newspaper advertising.
 * Sales (Units Sold), product units sold (dependent variable)
   
## Potential Risks

* Some potential risks I could have with this project are Outliers
*  Extreme ad budgets could distort model estimates. 
* some of the data not beign linear with the amount spent.

  
## Next steps:

My next few steps is to Clean and explore the dataset (summary statistics, correlations, visualizations), Fit a multiple linear regression model and Evaluate model performance.
